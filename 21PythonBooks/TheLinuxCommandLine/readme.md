### Introduction

Many people speak of 'freedom' with regard to Linux, but I don't think most  
people know what this freedom really meams. Freedom is the power to decide what  
your computer does, and the only way to have this freedom is to know what your  
computer is doing. Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where  
everything can be known if you care enough to find out.

Linux is not just a piece of software, it's also a small part of the larger Unix
culture, which has its own language and history.
